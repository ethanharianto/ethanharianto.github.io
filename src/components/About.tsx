        <p className="text-[15px] max-w-2xl">
          I thrive on building complete products, with experience spanning the entire stack: designing intuitive frontends,
          architecting distributed backends, and integrating data-intensive components.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[15px] max-w-2xl">
          Recent work includes realtime communication platforms, mobile applications for accessibility,
          and scalable diverse systems. I prioritize clean code, reliability, and shipping software that works.
